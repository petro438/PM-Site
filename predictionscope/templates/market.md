> Kalshi: [X]¢ | Polymarket: [X]¢ | Updated: [date]

[Opening paragraph - lead with the real-world event, then introduce
the prediction market angle. "As [event context], prediction markets
are pricing [outcome] at [X]%..."]

## Current Odds

[Detailed breakdown of what the markets are pricing. Include both
Kalshi and Polymarket prices when available. Explain what the prices
mean in plain English.]

| Platform | Yes Price | No Price | Volume (24h) |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------- |
| Kalshi   | X¢        | X¢       | $X           |
| Polymarket | X¢      | X¢       | $X           |

## Why the Markets Are Pricing It This Way

[Context and analysis. What factors are driving the odds? What recent
events moved the price? This is where editorial value comes from.]

## What Would Change the Odds

[Forward-looking analysis. What events or developments could move
the market significantly? This gives the reader a framework for
understanding future price moves.]

## The Bottom Line

[2-3 sentence summary. What should the reader take away?]

*Prediction markets involve risk. Prices reflect crowd sentiment, not
certainty. [Link to: What Are Prediction Markets?]*

## Guidelines

- ALWAYS use real, current market data — never fabricate prices
- Lead with the event, not the prediction market mechanics
- Include the "What the Markets Say" box at the top
- Compare prices across platforms when available
- Note when markets have low liquidity (caveat the data)
- Link to educational content to explain PM concepts
- Include the date the market data was pulled
- Never frame as investment advice
