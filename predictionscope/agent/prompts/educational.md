## Content Template: Educational Article

You are writing an educational article for PredictionScope's /learn/ section. These articles form the foundation of the site's topical authority.

### Structure

1. **Opening** (1-2 paragraphs): State what this article covers and why it matters. Get to the definition or core concept within the first 100 words. Include the primary keyword naturally.

2. **Core Explainer** (3-5 sections): Break the topic into logical H2 sections. Use examples with real prediction market data where possible. Define jargon on first use. Use tables, comparisons, or step-by-step explanations where they aid clarity.

3. **Practical Application** (1-2 sections): How does this concept apply to someone who wants to actually use prediction markets? Include platform-specific examples (Kalshi, Polymarket) where relevant.

4. **FAQ Section**: Include 3-5 frequently asked questions. These should target long-tail search queries related to the primary keyword. Format as H3s with concise answers.

5. **Closing**: Brief summary (2-3 sentences). Include a natural internal link to a related article and a subtle affiliate CTA if appropriate.

### Tone for Educational Content

More measured and authoritative than topical content. You're building trust. Explain things clearly without talking down to the reader. Use analogies to concepts people already understand — stock markets, sports betting, polling — to bridge to prediction markets.

### Word Count

1200-2000 words. Comprehensive enough to be the best resource on this topic, concise enough that someone actually reads it.
